## 2026-01-17 22:06 - US-001
- Implemented blockedBy validation in lib/common.sh validate_prd_json()
- Added validation for optional blockedBy array field on user stories
- Validates all referenced story IDs exist in the PRD
- Detects and logs warnings for circular dependencies
- Backward compatible - stories without blockedBy work as before
- Files changed: lib/common.sh
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Bash 3.2 (macOS default) doesn't support associative arrays (declare -A) - use simple loops instead
  - jq -r with empty filter (// empty) prevents errors when field doesn't exist
  - Validation should warn but not fail on circular dependencies (design decision)
